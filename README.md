# Description

Imagine you are building news validation site to prevent fake news. You first story is to
confirm that news fromÂ https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news is valid. The product
owner wants to start with a simple confirmation by checking other sources to confirm a
news article is valid. For the first news article on https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news
your task is to search google/other resources for similar information to confirm that the
article is valid.

### What to use

Using Cucumber, Selenium, and Java, create a few scenarios to achieve this functionality.

## Clone project from any folder

Clone project to any folder **without spaces/not ascii symbols on it**, eg: `c:\Users\name`

* if you use SSH:
    ```bash
        git clone
    ```
* or via HTTPS:
    ```bash
        git clone
    ```
Git should create a folder called `JPMC [news-framework]` with all the files in it.
